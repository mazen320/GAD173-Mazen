# GAD173

3/28/2021
Just made the git for this project. 

The things I got done 
So I got the main things out of the way, but I am struggling with a few little things that are not supposed to be taking this long.
- Created the Grid, and tile adder/remover

Things I need to get done
- Add tiles outside the 5x5 square, for some reason struggling with that.
- Saving loading.
